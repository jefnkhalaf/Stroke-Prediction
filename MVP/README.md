# MVP of Stroke Prediction

In this folder, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is provided. 

The required steps are provided in the Jupyter notebook. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase is done. 

## The MVP notebook summarizes the following: 
- Explore the features 
- Drop any unnecessary features
- Clean the dataset from any ambiguous values
- Create one-hot-encoding for some of the features
- Apply the model
- Train and test data with different models 

## There furthur steps to accomplish the project: 
- Use different models to predict strokes. 
- Dataset scaling
