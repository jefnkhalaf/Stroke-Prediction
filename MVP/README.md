# MVP of Stroke_Prediction

In this folder, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is provided.

The initial steps in details are provided in the Jupyter notebook.
The data explored in addition to the EDA workflow process.

## The MVP notebook summarizes the following:
- Explore the features
- Drop any unnecessary features
- Clean dataset
- Create one-hot-encoding for some features
- Label the data using ```Stroke```
- Train and test ```Logistic Regression``` model to predict the data and got train accuracy score of ```94.67%``` and ```92.99%``` for testing


The following figure illustrates the ratio of stroke and non-stroke:

The following figure shows one important predictor feature:

## There are a few more steps to finish the project:
- Imbalance dataset handling will be investigated  
- Use different models to predict stroke.
